## Software requirements and installation

### Python
We recommend using Python 3.7 or any future release. You can check your version by executing 

`$ python --version`

If the version is lower than 3.x try

`$ python3 --version`

if the version is still lower or if the python3 is not recognized, it can be installed from their webpage ([click me](https://www.python.org/)), from the microsoft store or using a package manager like apt (debian linux distros).

### Freegames
To install freegames we encourage you to use pip (python's package-management system). Execute

`$ pip --version`

or

`$ pip3 --version`

to check if its already installed. If pip is not installed, download the pip installer from their [webpage](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py), then run the installer

`$ python3 get-pip.py`

Finally install the freegames module:

`$ pip install freegames`
